# About me:

Hi, I'm Kevin. I am a Computer Science major at Georgia Institute of Technology with a passion for cybersecurity and networking. 

I enjoy solving CTF challenges, exploring, and understanding how secure systems are vulnerable to exploit. I am currently focused on pursuing a career in penetration tester, building hands-on experience in network, and system security.
