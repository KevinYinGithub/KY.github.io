    <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science major at Georgia Institute of Technology with a passion for cybersecurity and networking.
      I enjoy solving CTF challenges, exploring, and understanding how secure systems are vulnerable to exploit.
      I am currently focused on pursuing a career as a penetration tester, building hands-on experience in network and system security.
