<h1>Hi, I’m Kevin</h1>
<p>
I am a Computer Science major at Georgia Institute of Technology with a passion for cybersecurity and networking.
I enjoy solving CTF challenges, exploring, and understanding how secure systems are vulnerable to exploit.
I am currently focused on pursuing a career as a penetration tester, building hands-on experience in network and system security.
