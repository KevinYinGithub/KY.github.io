# Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin

I am a Computer Science major at Georgia Institute of Technology with a passion for cybersecurity and networking. 

I enjoy solving CTF challenges, exploring, and understanding how secure systems are vulnerable to exploit. I am currently focused on pursuing a career as a penetration tester, building hands-on experience in network and system security.
