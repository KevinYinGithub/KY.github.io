## Overview and Purpose
A Django web-based application that allows users to order movies online.  
This project was built as part of my exploration into web development and e-commerce platforms. Users can browse movies, add them to a cart, and complete purchases. The goal was to learn how to integrate Django models, views, and templates for a full-stack web application.

## Technical Details
- Built with Django framework and Python.
- Frontend uses HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript for interactive elements.
- Integrated with SQLite database for storing movie and user data.
- Implemented user authentication and cart management.

## Usage
- Users can browse movies by category, view details, add to cart, and checkout.
- Admins can add or remove movies and manage orders.

## Future Work
- Add payment gateway integration for real transactions.
- Implement search functionality and advanced filtering.
- Deploy the application to a cloud server for public access.
