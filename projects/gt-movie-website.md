## Overview
This web based application was developed using Django. It has a movie list where user could add movies to their shopping cart, a login page, a password authenication, an admin page to allow our developer team to manage movie list and user data, and a shopping cart page to allow the user to buy the movie. I was the team lead, organizing daily meetings between the development team and the client to ensure clear communication and progress tracking. In addition, I contributed as a back-end developer, implementing a secure password authentication system using javascript to protect user data.

## Technical Details
- Built with Django framework and Python.
- Frontend uses HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript for interactive elements.
- Integrated with SQLite database for storing movie, user data, and password.
- Implemented password authentication and cart management.

## What I learned
- This project is what led me to learning many useful languages for cybersecurity, such as html/css, SQL, and javascript.
